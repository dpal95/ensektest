# ensektest

Considerations:
  Unit tests to be added to add confidence in the out come of the code paths
  look to make the end point async
  code is written in such a way to be readable by most devs of all abilities
  small element of code duplication in reading of csv file. i would look to move this into its own method where needed
  would use branches instead of commiting directly to master
